Three-dimensional (scan number /mass-to-charge ratio/intensity) data from biotic and abiotic samples are obtained by pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The R-code created is for preprocessing these data and to use machine learning to predict whether a sample is biotic or abiotic (Preprocessing_training_and_test_data_random_forest).
Nested resampling is used to obtained an estimate for the prediction performance of the model (Nested_resampling_random_forest).

The resulting peaks from the preprocessing steps are aligned based on the paper by 
Tibshirani, R., et al. (2004)
